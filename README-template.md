### What I learned

I had a hard time with resizing the image I learned proper html semantics but copied over bit off css which gave me a hard time with the button which i spent a lot of time  on. I learned about the picture tag, about more about responsiveness.

### Step by Step
  1. HTML: I started with going thru and making the basic html. Then I remembered that I wanted to use the guide while making it (https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) so I went back and read thru it while editing. I also copied over a little bit of css that was in the guide.
  2. CSS: 
    2a. I started with the basic css. First I styled the text div to be able to properly see it. I tried to sle the image one also but it didn't work so i decided ot leave it for later. Then I did the text: font color,etc. The i did the button and content of the button. I had a lot of trouble with that. I tried every type of align i cld think of it and not of it worker. I tried commenting out different parts of the code. Finally I commented out the section I had added from the guide(fdgd) and it worker without any alignment. also the background color in button didn't work then it did. I also did a bunch of other basic css

    2c: I then continued ot work on the image styling. I finally got the picture to be the right size but its not covering its whole div. 
    3. I started making it responsive. I changed the text div to block and nothing happened. Container worked. Theres no inline in the css tho i thought i made it like that


    ### QUESTIONS
    1. Question: In the guide it said that tr and size had to be in span in order to be able to add the above styling(fdrgd).. However I had to remove that styling in order for it to be centered by itself. Can anyone explain to me what happened there?
    2. wy doesn't putting a border radius to container work. Why is there still no border radius after i added it to .image?
    3. Why did whenever i change the height of the image the height of text also changes?
    4. Why does it change to the other image so quickly?
    5. Am I supposed to use object fill?
    6. I had to manually put the width and height was i supposed to?
    Finally is there any unnecessary code or is there a better way of doing this then what i did?

### Continued development

I'm still not fully comfortable with flexbox anf responsiveness. I want to add accessibility to this.



### Useful resources

- [Guide to properly planning HTML](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - This helped me learn how to properly write out my HTML. I hadn't realized the importance of naming every tag and it helped me out a lot.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
