### What I learned

I had a hard time with resizing the image I learned proper html semantics but copied over bit off css which gave me a hard time with the button which i spent a lot of time  on. I learned about the picture tag, about more about responsiveness.

### Step by Step
1. HTML: I started by going through and making the basic HTML. Then I remembered that I wanted to use the guide while making it (https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/), so I went back and read through it while editing. I also copied over a little bit of CSS that was in the guide.
2. CSS:
2a. I started with the basic css. First I styled the text div to be able to properly see it. I tried to sle the image one also but it didn't work so I decided to leave it for later. Then I did the text: font color,etc. I did the button and the content of the button. I had a lot of trouble with that. I tried every type of alignment I could think of and none of it worked. I tried commenting out different parts of the code. Finally I commented out the section I had added from the guide(fdgd) and it worked without any alignment. Also, the background color on the button didn't work, but it did. I also did a bunch of other basic CSS.

2c: I then continued to work on the image styling. I finally got the picture to be the right size, but it's not covering its whole width.
3. I started making it responsive. I changed the text div to block, and nothing happened. Container worked. There's no inline in the CSS, though I thought I made it like that.


### QUESTIONS
1. Question: In the guide, it said that tr and size had to be in span in order to be able to add the above styling (fdrgd). However, I had to remove that styling in order for it to be centered by itself. Can anyone explain to me what happened there?
2. Why doesn't putting a border radius on the container work? Why is there still no border-radius after I added it to the image?
3. Why did, whenever I changed the height of the image, the height of the text also changed?
4. Why does it change to the other image so quickly?
    5. Am I supposed to use object fill?
6. I had to manually input the width and height; was I supposed to?

7. Where do I start with making this responsive?
Finally, is there any unnecessary code, or is there a better way of doing this than what I did?

### Continued Development

I'm still not fully comfortable with Flexbox and responsiveness. I want to add accessibility to this.




### Useful resources

- [Guide to properly planning HTML](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - This helped me learn how to properly write out my HTML. I hadn't realized the importance of naming every tag and it helped me out a lot.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
