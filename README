## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I had a hard time with resizing the image I learned proper html semantics but copied over bit off css which gave me a hard time with the button which i spent a lot of time  on. I learned about the picture tag, about more about responsiveness.

### QUESTIONS
1. In the guide, it said that tr and size had to be in span in order to be able to add the above styling (.c-product-card__btn {display: flex;align-items: center;gap: 1ch;}). However, I had to remove that styling in order for it to be centered by itself. Can anyone explain to me what happened there?
2. Why doesn't putting a border radius on the container work? Why is there still no border-radius after I added it to the image?
3. Whenver I trt centering the desktop the whole mobile gets ruined. How do I stop that?
4. I had to manually input a hegith in the picture tag in order for it to work. What was I supposed to do instead?
5. Is there any unnecessary code, or is there a better way of doing this than what I did?
And of course any other feedback would be greatly appreciated.

### Continued Development

I'm still not fully comfortable with Flexbox and responsiveness. I want to add accessibility to this.




### Useful resources

- [Guide to properly planning HTML](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - This helped me learn how to properly write out my HTML. I hadn't realized the importance of naming every tag and it helped me out a lot.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
